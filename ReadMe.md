GOAL

Aim- To classify different customers.

DESCRIPTION

This is a unsupervised learning problem where we need to make cluster of different customers. Perform EDA.

WHAT I HAD DONE

1. perfromed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the given dataset
2. it starts with loading the dataset and viewing the top 5 rows
3. we calculate statistical data in the dataset
4. then comes finding correlation between the features and also finding statistical values related to the dataset
5. data visualization is done with libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn
6. finally 3 different algorithms are used to find the best algorithm 
7. plotting different clusters of customers using scatter plot.

MODELS USED

1. K-Means Clustering
2. Hierarchial Clustering
3. Affinity Propogation


LIBRARIES NEEDED

1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Scikit-Learn

ACCURACIES

1. K-Means Clustering Score =  0.488577513553182
2. Hierarchial Clustering Score = 0.4746194694084842
3. Affinity Propogation Score = 0.4542059846314936

CONCLUSION

We can conclude that K-Means Clustering gives the most accurate results specifically for this problem statement.
